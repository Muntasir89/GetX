# getx_state_mngmnt
## Three basic Principles of GetX
- Performance: GetX is foucused on performance and minimum consumption of resources. When compared to other state management library, GetX wins the race.
- Productivity: GetX has very easy syntax and saves a lot of development time and hence increases productivity.
- Organization: GetX organizes the code by decoupling of the View, presentation logic, business logic, dependency injection and navigation.
## Pillars of GetX
- State Management: GetX has two different state managers
    - Simple State management (GetBulder)
    - Reactive State manager (GetX)
- Route Management: If we are using routes/snakebars/dialogs/bottomsheets then GetX is excellent because the mentioned feautures can be used without using context.
- Dependency Management: GetX has powerful dependency manager that allows us to retrieve the controller by 1 line of code without using Provider Context or InheritedWidget.
